## Project Overview
Access to electricity is vital for economic development and societal well-being. Nations with reliable
electricity tend to exhibit higher productivity, an improved standard of living, and enhanced
competitiveness in the global market. Electricity plays a crucial role across various sectors, including
agriculture, education, and healthcare, ensuring their efficient operations. This research endeavours to
analyze data from 1990 to 2021 to discern patterns and trends in electricity access across African countries.
Leveraging regional and income data, alongside predictive modelling techniques, our goal is to offer
insights that can guide policy decisions and interventions aimed at understanding electricity access in the
region.

According to data analysis and projections from the International Energy Agency (IEA), approximately 110
million new connections are required annually starting in 2022. However, given the current pace observed
in recent years, this target remains significantly off track (IEA, 2023). (https://www.iea.org/reports/sdg7-
data-and-projections). The idea of this project is to analyze and track the trend of electricity access in Africa
and attempt to develop predictive modelling of electricity access in Africa to identify significant statistical
relationships and differences through the forecast and trends.


## Problem Statement

The problem that this study addresses revolves around the persistent challenge of low electricity access in 
various African countries.
If this issue remains unaddressed, it could have severe consequences, impacting millions of people and 
impeding socio-economic development in these countries. The lack of electricity access hinders progress 
towards achieving the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of promoting inclusive and 
sustainable economic growth.
To effectively tackle this challenge, robust forecasting techniques like the ARIMA model need to be utilized 
to project electricity access levels until 2030. This approach aligns with the recommendations of scholars 
like Ma et al. (2019), who advocate for extended-duration forecasting models to address the complexities of 
energy access planning in African countries.
